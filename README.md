**Overview**

This project demonstrates a basic registration form using HTML, incorporating both GET and POST methods for handling form submissions.

**Key Files**

* **index.html:** Contains the HTML structure for the registration form.
* **process.php:** (Optional) Server-side script for processing form data submitted using the POST method.

**GET vs. POST Methods**

* **GET:** Appends form data to the URL, making it visible in the address bar. Use for non-sensitive data or actions that don't modify data on the server.
* **POST:** Hides form data within the request body, suitable for sensitive information or actions that change server-side data.

**Running the Project**

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Fill out the form and submit it using either the GET or POST button.
3. Observe the behavior and any output generated by the script (if using POST).

**Additional Notes**

* For a more comprehensive form experience, you may want to include:
    - Additional form fields (e.g., email, address).
    - Input validation (e.g., checking for empty fields or invalid email formats).
    - Error handling (e.g., displaying informative messages for invalid input).
* If using a server-side script (`process.php`), ensure it's configured properly to handle POST requests.
* Consider security implications, especially when handling sensitive user data.
